<h2 id="early-life">Early Life</h2>
<p>Milo Ray Baughman was an American modern furniture designer. He was born in Kansas on October 7, 1923. When he was very young, his family made a big move to Long Beach, California, which was where he grew up and got most of his influences. When Milo was only 13, he already took on the task of designing both interiors and exteriors of his family home.</p>
<p>His family expected Baughman to pursue a design degree right after he graduated from high school but this was cut short as the designer signed up for the Army Air Forces instead during the Second World War. One fascinating fact about Baughman was despite being in the Air Forces, he still dabbled in design, designing many officer’s clubs. The end of the war had him return to his hometown, where he finally pursued architectural design at L.A’s Art Center School and Chouinard Art Institute.</p>
<h2 id="early-work">Early Work</h2>
<p>At only 24 years old. Baughman started his own design company and quickly received commissions from Glenn of California. It was these commissioned works that allowed him to develop his distinct design aesthetic, more popularly known these days as “California Modern”.</p>
<h2 id="thayer-coggin">Thayer Coggin</h2>
<p>Events in 1953 were said to really define Baughman’s career. He met and started working with Thayer Coggin. Their partnership survived and flourished over 5 decades. During their stint together, they created many iconic pieces like the 989-103 chair, as well as the 825-301 LAF sofa, known for its semi-circle shape.</p>
<h2 id="baughman-s-work">Baughman’s Work</h2>
<p>Baughman was always very vocal about furniture that was too obviously designed. One of his more famous quotes have him say that furniture like this only belong in museums. His design philosophy follows those words, as Baughman’s pieces always had an easy and relaxed look to them.</p>
<p>Baughman celebrated plenty of “new” mid-century modern materials made available after the war and incorporated them into his pieces. One may notice that he commonly used stainless steel, chrome, glass and leather to create his furniture.</p>
<p>The designer was also very much a believer in affordable furniture that many people would be able to enjoy, and this also influenced his work to an extent. Many of his pieces also feature a high and low mix, mixing more luxurious upholstery with more common warm woods and mass-produced glass. There was also an emphasis to design pieces that were not only comfortable and inviting, but also times and very universal, so that families would not feel the need to switch out their furniture very often, saving them money, and allowing them years of enjoyment on these pieces.</p>
<p>However, as Baughman’s work and influence grew, it could not be helped that his pieces rose in price, and therefore, attracted a higher end market. In an article that he wrote in the October 1970 issue of Architectural digest, the designer divulged that he also experienced conflict with regards to his design philosophy of designing affordable furniture for the masses. Baughman also touched on the obsession that most people had of having to have the right look. For him, it had to go beyond this, as he, and others, were slowly realizing that furniture- how it looked and its placement- not only had to look right, but feel right as well, ultimately working for the home dwellers once company and visitors had gone away.</p>
<h2 id="milo-baughman-today">Milo Baughman Today</h2>
<p>Baughman’s works have become so prolific that up to this day, numerous designers continue to mimic his pieces. A number of the furniture that he created, such as the Case sofa- a squarish, boxy looking couch and scoop chairs are already considered “modern classics”.</p>
